			<h2>What is Software Engineering?</h2><br>
			<p>Software engineering is defined as a process of analyzing user requirements and then
				designing, building, and testing software application which will satisfy those
				requirements.</p><br>
			<p>Let's look at the various definitions of software engineering:</p><br>
			<ul>
				<li>IEEE, in its standard 610.12-1990, defines software engineering as the application
					of a systematic, disciplined, which is a computable approach for the
					development, operation, and maintenance of software.</li>
				<li>Fritz Bauer defined it as 'the establishment and used standard engineering
					principles. It helps you to obtain, economically, software which is reliable and
					works efficiently on the real machines'.</li>
				<li>Boehm defines software engineering, which involves, 'the practical application of
					scientific knowledge to the creative design and building of computer programs.
					It also includes associated documentation needed for developing, operating, and
					maintaining them.'</li>

			<h2>Why Software Engineering? Software Crisis & its Solution:</h2><br>
			<h3>What was the Software Crisis?</h3><br>
			<ol>
				<li>It was in the late 1960s when many software projects failed.</li>
				<li>Many software became over budget. Output was an unreliable software which is
					expensive to maintain.
				<li>Larger software was difficult and quite expensive to maintain.
				<li>Lots of software not able to satisfy the growing requirements of the customer.
				<li>Complexities of software projects increased whenever its hardware capability
					increased.
				<li>Demand for new software increased faster compared with the ability to generate new
					software.</li>
			</ol><br>
			<p>All the above issues lead to 'Software Crisis.'</p><br>
			<h3>The Solution</h3><br>
			<p>Solution was to the problem was transforming unorganized coding effort into a software
				engineering discipline. These engineering models helped companies to streamline
				operations and deliver software meeting customer requirements.</p><br>
			<ul>
				<li>The late 1970s saw the widespread uses of software engineering principles.</li>
				<li>In the 1980s saw the automation of software engineering process and growth of (CASE)
					Computer-Aided Software Engineering.</li>
				<li>The 1990s have seen an increased emphasis on the 'management' aspects of projects
					standard of quality and processes just like ISO 9001</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Why Software Engineering is Popular?</h2><br>
			<p>Here are important reasons behind the popularity of software engineering:</p><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/se.png" width="90%" alt="Software Engineering">
			</figure><br>
			<dl>
				<dt>
					<h3>Large software â€“</h3>
				</dt><br>
				<dd>In our real life, it is quite more comfortable to build a wall than a house or
					building. In the same manner, as the size of the software becomes large,
					software engineering helps you to build software.</dd><br>
				<dt>
					<h3>Scalability-</h3>
				</dt><br>
				<dd>If the software development process were based on scientific and engineering
					concepts, it is easier to re-create new software to scale an existing one.</dd>
				<br>
				<dt>
					<h3>Adaptability:</h3>
				</dt><br>
				<dd>Whenever the software process was based on scientific and engineering, it is easy to
					re-create new software with the help of software engineering.</dd><br>
				<dt>
					<h3>Cost-</h3>
				</dt><br>
				<dd>Hardware industry has shown its skills and huge manufacturing has lower the cost of
					the computer and electronic hardware.</dd><br>
				<dt>
					<h3>Dynamic Nature- </h3>
				</dt><br>
				<dd>Always growing and adapting nature of the software. It depends on the environment in
					which the user works.</dd><br>
				<dt>
					<h3>Quality Management:</h3>
				</dt><br>
				<dd>Offers better method of software development to provide quality software products.
				</dd>
			</dl>

			<h2>Relationship of Software Engineering with Other Disciplines</h2><br>
			<p>Here, how software engineering related to other disciplines:</p><br>
			<dl>
				<dt>
					<h3>Computer Science: </h3>
				</dt><br>
				<dd>Gives the scientific foundation for the software as electrical engineering mainly
					depends on physics.</dd><br>
				<dt>
					<h3>Management Science:</h3>
				</dt><br>
				<dd>Software engineering is labor-intensive work which demands both technical and
					managerial control. Therefore, it is widely used in management science.</dd><br>
				<dt>
					<h3>Economics:</h3>
				</dt><br>
				<dd>In this sector, software engineering helps you in resource estimation and cost
					control. Computing system must be developed, and data should be maintained
					regularly within a given budget.</dd><br>
				<dt>
					<h3>System Engineering: </h3>
				</dt><br>
				<dd>Most software is a component of a much larger system. For example, the software in
					an Industry monitoring system or the flight software on an airplane. Software
					engineering methods should be applied to the study of this type of systems.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>In deep learning, the learning phase is done through a neural network. A neural network is an
				architecture where the layers are stacked on top of each other.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Challenges of Software Engineering</h2><br>
			<p>Here are some critical challenges faced by software engineers:</p><br>
			<ul>
				<li>In safety-critical areas such as space, aviation, nuclear power plants, etc. the
					cost of software failure can be massive because lives are at risk.</li>
				<li>Increased market demands for fast turnaround time.</li>
				<li>Dealing with the increased complexity of software need for new applications.</li>
				<li>The diversity of software systems should be communicating with each other.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Attributes for Software Products</h2><br>
			<p>The characteristics of any software product include features which are displayed by the
				product when it is installed and put in use.</p><br>
			<p>They are not the services which are provided by the product. Instead, they have related to
				the products dynamic behavior and the use made of the product.</p><br>
			<p>Examples of these attributes are:</p><br>
			<p>Efficiency, reliability, robustness, maintainability, etc.</p><br>
			<p>However, the relative importance of these characteristics varies from one software system to
				another.</p><br>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Product Characteristics</th>
					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Maintainability</td>
					<td>The software should evolve to meet the changing demands of the clients.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Dependability</td>
					<td>Dependability includes various characteristics. Dependable software should
						never cause any physical or economic damage at the time of system
						failure.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Efficiency</td>
					<td>The software application should overuse system resources like memory and
						processor cycle.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Usability</td>
					<td>The software application should have specific UI and documentation.</td>
				</tr>
			</table><br><br>
			<p>Optimizing the above attribute is very challenging. For example, offering a better UI can
				reduce system efficiency.</p>
		</section>

			<h2>Characteristics of Good Software</h2><br>
			<p>Any software should be judged by what it offers and what are the methods which help you to
				use it.</p><br>
			<p>Every software must satisfy the following attributes:</p><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Operational</li>
				<li>Transitional</li>
				<li>Maintenance</li>
			</ul><br>
			<p>Here are some important characteristics of good software developed by software professionals
			</p><br>
			<h3>Operational</h3><br>
			<p>This characteristic let us know about how well software works in the operations which can be
				measured on:</p><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Budget</li>
				<li>Efficiency</li>
				<li>Usability</li>
				<li>Dependability</li>
				<li>Correctness</li>
				<li>Functionality</li>
				<li>Safety</li>
				<li>Security</li>
			</ul><br>
			<h3>Transitional</h3><br>
			<p>This is an essential aspect when the software is moved from one platform to another:</p><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Interoperability</li>
				<li>Reusability</li>
				<li>Portability</li>
				<li>Adaptability</li>
			</ul><br>
			<h3>Maintenance</h3><br>
			<p>This aspect talks about how well software has the capabilities to adapt itself in the quickly
				changing environment:</p><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Flexibility</li>
				<li>Maintainability</li>
				<li>Modularity</li>
				<li>Scalability</li>
			</ul>
