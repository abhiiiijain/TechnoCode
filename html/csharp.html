			<h2>What is C# /C Sharp (programming language)?</h2><br>
			<p>C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing,
				lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented
				(class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.It was developed around
				2000 by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative and later approved as an international
				standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270) in 2003. Mono is the name of
				the free and open-source project to develop a compiler and runtime for the language. C#
				is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure
				(CLI).</p><br>
			<p>C# was designed by Anders Hejlsberg, and its development team is currently led by Mads
				Torgersen. The most recent version is 8.0, which was released in 2019 alongside Visual
				Studio 2019 version 16.3.</p><br>

			<h2>Design goals</h2><br>
			<p>The Ecma standard lists these design goals for C#:</p><br>
			<ul>
				<li>The language is intended to be a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented
					programming language.</li>
				<li>The language, and implementations thereof, should provide support for software
					engineering principles such as strong type checking, array bounds checking,
					detection of attempts to use uninitialized variables, and automatic garbage
					collection. Software robustness, durability, and programmer productivity are
					important.</li>
				<li>The language is intended for use in developing software components suitable for
					deployment in distributed environments.</li>
				<li>Portability is very important for source code and programmers, especially those
					already familiar with C and C++.</li>
				<li>Support for internationalization is very important.</li>
				<li>C# is intended to be suitable for writing applications for both hosted and embedded
					systems, ranging from the very large that use sophisticated operating systems,
					down to the very small having dedicated functions.</li>
				<li>Although C# applications are intended to be economical with regard to memory and
					processing power requirements, the language was not intended to compete directly
					on performance and size with C or assembly language.</li>
			</ul><br>

			<h2>History of C#:</h2><br>
			<p>During the development of the .NET Framework, the class libraries were originally written
				using a managed code compiler system called "Simple Managed C" (SMC). In January 1999,
				Anders Hejlsberg formed a team to build a new language at the time called Cool, which
				stood for "C-like Object Oriented Language. Microsoft had considered keeping the name
				"Cool" as the final name of the language, but chose not to do so for trademark reasons.
				By the time the .NET project was publicly announced at the July 2000 Professional
				Developers Conference, the language had been renamed C#, and the class libraries and
				ASP.NET runtime had been ported to C#.</p><br>
			<p>Hejlsberg is C#'s principal designer and lead architect at Microsoft, and was previously
				involved with the design of Turbo Pascal, Embarcadero Delphi (formerly CodeGear Delphi,
				Inprise Delphi and Borland Delphi), and Visual J++. In interviews and technical papers
				he has stated that flaws in most major programming languages (e.g. C++, Java, Delphi,
				and Smalltalk) drove the fundamentals of the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which, in
				turn, drove the design of the C# language itself.</p><br>
			<p>James Gosling, who created the Java programming language in 1994, and Bill Joy, a co-founder
				of Sun Microsystems, the originator of Java, called C# an "imitation" of Java; Gosling
				further said that "[C# is] sort of Java with reliability, productivity and security
				deleted. Klaus Kreft and Angelika Langer (authors of a C++ streams book) stated in a
				blog post that "Java and C# are almost identical programming languages. Boring
				repetition that lacks innovation,"Hardly anybody will claim that Java or C# are
				revolutionary programming languages that changed the way we write programs," and "C#
				borrowed a lot from Java - and vice versa. Now that C# supports boxing and unboxing,
				we'll have a very similar feature in Java. In July 2000, Hejlsberg said that C# is "not
				a Java clone" and is "much closer to C++" in its design.</p><br>
			<p>Since the release of C# 2.0 in November 2005, the C# and Java languages have evolved on
				increasingly divergent trajectories, becoming two quite different languages. One of the
				first major departures came with the addition of generics to both languages, with vastly
				different implementations. C# makes use of reification to provide "first-class" generic
				objects that can be used like any other class, with code generation performed at
				class-load time. Furthermore, C# has added several major features to accommodate
				functional-style programming, culminating in the LINQ extensions released with C# 3.0
				and its supporting framework of lambda expressions, extension methods, and anonymous
				types. These features enable C# programmers to use functional programming techniques,
				such as closures, when it is advantageous to their application. The LINQ extensions and
				the functional imports help developers reduce the amount of boilerplate code that is
				included in common tasks like querying a database, parsing an xml file, or searching
				through a data structure, shifting the emphasis onto the actual program logic to help
				improve readability and maintainability.</p><br>
			<p>C# used to have a mascot called Andy (named after Anders Hejlsberg). It was retired on
				January 29, 2004.</p><br>
			<p>C# was originally submitted to the ISO subcommittee JTC 1/SC 22 for review, under ISO/IEC
				23270:2003, was withdrawn and was then approved under ISO/IEC 23270:2006. </p><br>

			<h2>C# Data Types</h2><br>
			<h3>What are Data Types in C#?</h3><br>
			<p>The C# language comes with a set of Basic data types. These data types are used to build
				values which are used within an application. Let's explore the basic data types
				available in C#. For each example, we will modify just the main function in our
				Program.cs file.</p><br>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3>Integer</h3>
					<p>An Integer data types are used to work with numbers. In this case, the
						numbers are whole numbers like 10, 20 or 30. In C#, the datatype is
						denoted by the Int32 keyword. Below is an example of how this datatype
						can be used. In our example, we will define an Int32 variable called
						num. We will then assign an Integer value to the variable and then
						display it accordingly.</p><br>

				</li><br>
				<li>
					<h3>Double</h3>
					<p>A double data type is used to work with decimals. In this case, the numbers
						are whole numbers like 10.11, 20.22 or 30.33. In C#, the datatype is
						denoted by the keyword "Double". Below is an example of this datatype.

					<h3>Boolean</h3>
					<p>A boolean data type is used to work with Boolean values of true and false. In
						C#, the datatype is denoted by the Boolean keyword. Below is an example
						of this datatype can be used.</p><br>

			<h2>C# IF, Switch, For, While Loop Statements</h2><br>
			<h3>Flow Control and conditional statements</h3><br>
			<p>Flow control and conditional statements are available in any programming language to alter
				the flow of a program.</p><br>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3>If statement</h3><br>
					<p>The if statement is used to evaluate a boolean expression before executing a
						set of statements. If an expression evaluates to true, then it will run
						one set of statements else it will run another set of statements.</p>
					<br>
					<figure class="a">
						<img src="../images/cc12.png" width="80%" alt="C# subfields">
					</figure><br>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Switch statement</h3><br>
					<p>The switch statement is an enhancement to the 'if' statement. If you have
						multiple expressions that need to be evaluated in one shot, then writing
						multiple 'if' statements becomes an issue.</p><br>
					<p>The switch statement is used to evaluate an expression and run different
						statements based on the result of the expression. If one condition does
						not evaluate to true, the switch statement will then move to the next
						condition and so forth.</p><br>

					<h3>While loop</h3><br>
					<p>The while loop is used for iterative purposes. Suppose if you want to repeat
						a certain set of statements for a particular number of times, then while
						loop is used.</p><br>
					<figure class="a">

					<h3> For loop</h3><br>
					<p>The 'for' loop is also used for iterative purposes. Suppose if you want to
						repeat a certain set of statements for a particular number of times,
						then forloop is used.</p><br>

			<h2>C# Array</h2><br>
			<h3>What is an Arrays in C#?</h3><br>
			<p>An array is used to store a collection or series of elements. These elements will be of the
				same type.</p><br>
			<p>Arrays are useful when you want to store a collection of values of the same type. So instead
				of declaring a variable for every element, you can just declare one variable.</p><br>
			<p>This variable will point to an array or list of elements, which will be responsible for
				storing the elements of the array.</p><br>
			<h4>Steps:</h4><br>
			<ol>
				<li>Declaring an array – The first step is to declare an array. Let's see how we can
					achieve this by the below code example.
					<figure class="a">
						<img src="../images/cc16.png" width="80%" alt="C# subfields">
					</figure><br>
				</li>
				<li>The next step is to initialize the array. Here we are going to specify the number of
					values the array will hold. We are also going to assign values to each element
					of the array.

			<h2>C# Class & Object</h2><br>
			<p>C# is based on the C++ programming language. Hence, the C# programming language has in-built
				support for classes and objects. A class is nothing but an encapsulation of properties
				and methods that are used to represent a real-time entity.</p><br>
			<h3>What is Class and Object?</h3><br>
			<p>A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Basically, a
				class combines the fields and methods(member function which defines actions) into a
				single unit. In C#, classes support polymorphism, inheritance and also provide the
				concept of derived classes and base classes.</p><br>
			<h3>How to Create a Class and Object</h3><br>
			<p>Let's now dive into Visual Studio to create our class. We are going to build upon our
				existing console application which was created in our earlier chapter. We will create a
				class in Visual Studio for our current application.</p><br>
			<h4>Steps:</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>The first step involves the creation of a new class within our exist
					<figure class="a">
						<img src="../images/cc18.png" width="80%" alt="C# subfields">
					</figure><br>
					<ol type="i">
						<li>The first step is to the right click on the solution, which in our
							case is 'DemoApplication'. This will bring up a context menu
							with a list of options.</li>
						<li>From the context menu choose the option Add->Class. This will
							provide the option to add a class to the existing project.</li>
					</ol>
				</li><br>
				<li>The next step is to provide a name for the class and add it to our solution.
					<figure class="a">
						<img src="../images/cc19.png" width="80%" alt="C# subfields">
					</figure><br>
					<ol type="i">
						<li>In the project dialog box, we first need to provide a name for our
							class. Let's provide a name of Tutorial.cs for our class. Note
							that the file name should end with .cs to ensure it is treated
							as a proper class file.</li>
						<li>When we click the Add button, the class will be added to our
							solution.</li>
					</ol>
				</li><br>
				<p>If the above steps are followed, you will get the below output in Visual Studio.</p>
