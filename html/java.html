			<h2>What is Java Platform?</h2><br>
			<p>Java platform is a collection of programs that help to develop and run programs written in
				the Java programming language. Java platform includes an execution engine, a compiler,
				and a set of libraries. JAVA is platform-independent language. It is not specific to any
				processor or operating system.</p><br>
			<p>This video introduces the Java platform, and explains why Java is a platform as well as a
				programming language.</p><br>
			<p>To understand JAVA programming language, we need to understand some basic concept of how a
				computer program can run a command and execute the action.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>What is PC?</h2><br>
			<p>A computer is an electronic device capable of performing computations, and we all know that
				it is composed of a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and memory to store information. But the
				most important component of the computer is a PROCESSOR. Which does all thinking of
				computer, but the question is how the computer does this thinking? How does it
				understand text, images, videos, etc.?</p><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/java1.png" width="80%" alt="Java subfields">
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>What is Assembly Language?</h2><br>
			<p>The computer is an electronic device, and it can only understand electronic signals or binary
				signals. For example, the 5-volt electronic signal may represent binary number 1 while 0
				volts may represent binary number 0. So your PC is continuously bombarded with these
				signals.</p><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/java2.png" width="80%" alt="java subfields">
			</figure><br>
			<p>Eight bits of such signals are group together to interpret Text, numerical and symbols.</p>
			<br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/java3.png" width="80%" alt="java subfields">
			</figure><br>
			<p>For example, the # symbol is identified by computer as 10101010. Similarly, the pattern for
				adding a function is represented by 10000011.</p><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/java4.png" width="80%" alt="java subfields">
			</figure><br>
			<p>This is known as 8-bit computing. Current day processor is capable of decoding 64-bit time.
				But what is the relation of this concept with the programming language JAVA? Let
				understand these as an example.</p><br>
			<p>Suppose if you want to tell the computer to add two number (1+2) which is represented by some
				binary numbers (10000011), how are you going to tell the computer? Yes, we going to use
				assembly language to get our code executed.</p><br>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>"Assembly Language is the most elementary form of software development languages."</h2><br>
			<p>We are going to give the command to a computer in this format as shown below. Your code to
				add two numbers in this language would be in this order.</p><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/java5.png" width="80%" alt="java subfields">
			</figure><br>
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Store number 1 at memory location say A</li>
				<li>Store number 2 at memory location say B</li>
				<li>Add contents of Location A & B</li>
				<li>Store results</li>
			</ul><br>
			</p>
			<p>But how are we going to do this? Back in 1950's when computers were huge and consumed a great
				deal of power, you would convert your assembly code into corresponding machine code to 1
				and 0's using mapping sheets. Later this code will be punched into the machine cards and
				feed to the computer. The computer will read these code and execute the program. These
				would be a long process then until ASSEMBLER came to help.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>What are Assembler and Compiler?</h2><br>
			<p>With the advancement in technology i/o devices were invented, you could directly type your
				program into the PC using a program called ASSEMBLER. It converts it into corresponding
				machine code (110001..) and feeds to your processor. So coming back to our example
				addition of (1+2), the assembler will convert this code into machine code and give the
				output.</p><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/java6.png" width="80%" alt="Java subfields">
			</figure><br>
			<p>That apart, you will also have to make calls to create Operating System provided functions to
				display the output of the code.</p><br>
			<p>But alone assembler is not involved in this whole process; it also requires the compiler to
				compile the long code into a small chunk of codes. With advancement in software
				development languages, this entire assembly code could shrink into just one line print f
				1+2 A with the help of software called COMPILER. It is used to convert your c language
				code into assembly code, and the assembler converts it into corresponding machine code,
				and this machine code will be transmitted to the processor. The most common processor
				used in PC or Computers are Intel processor.</p><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/java7.png" width="80%" alt="Java subfields">
			</figure><br>
			<p>Though present-day compilers come bundled with assembler can directly convert your higher
				language code into machine code.</p><br>
			<p>Now, suppose Windows operating system is running on this Intel processor, a combination of
				Operating System plus the processor is called the PLATFORM.</p><br>
			<p>The most common platform in the world is the Windows, and Intel called the Wintel Platform.
				The other popular platforms are AMD and Linux, Power PC, and Mac OS X.</p><br>
			<p>Now, with a change in processor, the assembly instructions will also change. For example the
			</p><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Add instruction in Intel may be called ADDITION for AMD</li>
				<li>OR Math ADD for Power PC</li>
			</ul><br>
			<p>And obviously, with a change in Operating System, the level and nature of O.S level calls
				will also change.</p><br>
			<p>As a developer, I want my software program to work on all platforms available, to maximize my
				revenues. So I would have to buy separate compilers which convert my print f command
				into the native machine code.</p><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/java8.png" width="80%" alt="Java subfields">
			</figure><br>
			<p>But compilers come expensive, and there is a chance of compatibility issues. So buying and
				installing a separate compiler for different O.S and processor is not feasible. So, what
				can be an alternative solution? Enter Java language.</p><br>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>How Java Virtual Machine works?</h2><br>
			<p>By using Java Virtual Machine, this problem can be solved. But how it works on different
				processors and O.S. Let's understand this process step by step.</p><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/java9.png" width="80%" alt="Java subfields">
			</figure><br>
			<h4>Steps</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>The code to display addition of two numbers is System.out.println(1+2), and saved as
					.java file.</li>
				<li>Using the java compiler the code is converted into an intermediate code called the
					bytecode. The output is a .class file.</li>
				<li>This code is not understood by any platform, but only a virtual platform called the
					Java Virtual Machine.</li>
				<li>This Virtual Machine resides in the RAM of your operating system. When the Virtual
					Machine is fed with this bytecode, it identifies the platform it is working on
					and converts the bytecode into the native machine code.</li>
			</ol><br>
			<p>In fact, while working on your PC or browsing the web whenever you see either of these icons
				be assured the java virtual machine is loaded into your RAM. But what makes java
				lucrative is that code once compiled can run not only on all PC platforms but also
				mobiles or other electronic gadgets supporting java.</p><br>
			<h3>"Java is a programming language as well as a Platform"</h3><br>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>How is Java Platform Independent?</h2><br>
			<p>Like C compiler, Java compiler does not produce native executable code for a particular
				machine. Instead, Java produces a unique format called bytecode. It executes according
				to the rules laid out in the virtual machine specification.</p><br>
			<p>Bytecode is understandable to any JVM installed on any OS. In short, the java source code can
				run on all operating systems.</p><br>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Java Virtual Machine (JVM) & its Architecture</h2><br>
			<h2>What is JVM?</h2><br>
			<p>
			<h4>Java Virtual Machine (JVM) </h4>
			<p>It is a engine that provides runtime environment to drive the Java Code or applications. It
				converts Java bytecode into machines language. JVM is a part of Java Run Environment
				(JRE). In other programming languages, the compiler produces machine code for a
				particular system. However, Java compiler produces code for a Virtual Machine known as
				Java Virtual Machine.</p><br>
			<h4>Here is how JVM works</h4><br>
			<p>First, Java code is complied into bytecode. This bytecode gets interpreted on different
				machines</p><br>
			<p>Between host system and Java source, Bytecode is an intermediary language.</p><br>
			<p>JVM is responsible for allocating memory space.
			</p><br>

			<h2>JVM Architecture</h2><br>
			<p>Let's understand the Architecture of JVM. It contains classloader, memory area, execution
				engine etc.</p><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/java11.png" width="80%" alt="java subfields">
			</figure><br>
			<ol>
				<h3>
					<li>ClassLoader</li>
				</h3>
				<p>The class loader is a subsystem used for loading class files. It performs three major
					functions viz. Loading, Linking, and Initialization.</p><br>
				<h3>
					<li>Method Area</li>
				</h3>
				<p>JVM Method Area stores class structures like metadata, the constant runtime pool, and
					the code for methods.</p><br>
				<h3>
					<li>Heap</li>
				</h3>
				<p>All the Objects, their related instance variables, and arrays are stored in the heap.
					This memory is common and shared across multiple threads.</p><br>
				<h3>
					<li>JVM language Stacks</li>
				</h3>
				<p>Java language Stacks store local variables, and it’s partial results. Each thread has
					its own JVM stack, created simultaneously as the thread is created. A new frame
					is created whenever a method is invoked, and it is deleted when method
					invocation process is complete.</p><br>
				<h3>
					<li>PC Registers</li>
				</h3>
				<p>PC register store the address of the Java virtual machine instruction which is
					currently executing. In Java, each thread has its separate PC register.</p><br>
				<h3>
					<li>Native Method Stacks</li>
				</h3>
				<p>Native method stacks hold the instruction of native code depends on the native
					library. It is written in another language instead of Java.</p><br>
				<h3>
					<li>Execution Engine</li>
				</h3>
				<p>It is a type of software used to test hardware, software, or complete systems. The
					test execution engine never carries any information about the tested product.
				</p><br>
				<h3>
					<li>Native Method interface</li>
				</h3>
				<p>The Native Method Interface is a programming framework. It allows Java code which is
					running in a JVM to call by libraries and native applications.</p><br>
				<h3>
					<li>Native Method Libraries</li>
				</h3>
				<p>Native Libraries is a collection of the Native Libraries(C, C++) which are needed by
					the Execution Engine.</p><br>

			<h2>Software Code Compilation & Execution process</h2><br>
			<p>In order to write and execute a software program, you need the following</p><br>
			<ol>
				<h3>
					<li>Editor</li>
				</h3>
				<p>To type your program into, a notepad could be used for this</p><br>
				<h3>
					<li>Compiler</li>
				</h3>
				<p>To convert your high language program into native machine code</p><br>
				<h3>
					<li>Linker</li>
				</h3>
				<p>To combine different program files reference in your main program together.</p><br>
				<h3>
					<li>Loader</li>
				</h3>
				<p>To load the files from your secondary storage device like Hard Disk, Flash Drive, CD
					into RAM for execution. The loading is automatically done when you execute your
					code.</p><br>
				<h3>
					<li>Execution</li>
				</h3>
				<p>Actual execution of the code which is handled by your OS & processor.</p><br>
			</ol>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>C code Compilation and Execution process</h2><br>
			<p>To understand the Java compiling process in Java. Let's first take a quick look to compiling
				and linking process in C.</p><br>
			<p>Suppose in the main, you have called two function f1 and f2.</p>
			<h4>The main function is stored in file a1.c.</h4><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/java12.png" width="80%" alt="java subfields">
			</figure><br>
			<h4>Function f1 is stored in a file a2.c</h4><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/java13.png" width="80%" alt="java subfields">
			</figure><br>
			<h4>Function f2 is stored in a file a3.c</h4><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/java14.png" width="80%" alt="java subfields">
			</figure><br>
			<p>All these files, i.e., a1.c, a2.c, and a3.c, is fed to the compiler. Whose output is the
				corresponding object files which are the machine code.</p><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/java15.png" width="80%" alt="java subfields">
			</figure><br>
			<p>The next step is integrating all these object files into a single .exe file with the help of
				linker. The linker will club all these files together and produces the .exe file.</p>
			<br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/java16.png" width="80%" alt="java subfields">
			</figure><br>
			<p>During program run, a loader program will load a.exe into the RAM for the execution.</p><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/java17.png" width="80%" alt="java subfields">
			</figure><br>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Java code Compilation and Execution in Java VM</h2><br>
			<p>Let's look at the process for JAVA. In your main, you have two methods f1 and f2.</p><br>
			<ul>
				<li>The main method is stored in file a1.java</li>
				<li>f1 is stored in a file as a2.java</li>
				<li>f2 is stored in a file as a3.java</li>
			</ul><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/java18.png" width="80%" alt="java subfields">
			</figure><br>
			<p>The compiler will compile the three files and produces 3 corresponding .class file which
				consists of BYTE code.</p><br>
			<h4>Unlike C, no linking is done.</h4><br>
			<p>The Java VM or Java Virtual Machine resides on the RAM. During execution, using the class
				loader the class files are brought on the RAM. The BYTE code is verified for any
				security breaches.</p><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/java19.png" width="80%" alt="java subfields">
			</figure><br>
			<p>Next, the execution engine will convert the Bytecode into Native machine code. This is just
				in time compiling. It is one of the main reason why Java is comparatively slow.</p><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/java20.png" width="80%" alt="java subfields">
			</figure><br>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Why is Java both Interpreted and Compiled Language?</h2><br>
			<h4>Programming languages are classified as</h4><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Higher Level Language Ex. C++, Java</li>
				<li>Middle-Level Languages Ex. C</li>
				<li>Low-Level Language Ex Assembly</li>
				<li>finally the lowest level as the Machine Language.</li>
			</ul><br>
			<p>A compiler is a program which converts a program from one level of language to another.
				Example conversion of C++ program into machine code.</p><br>
			<p>The java compiler converts high-level java code into bytecode (which is also a type of
				machine code).</p><br>
			<p>An interpreter is a program which converts a program at one level to another programming
				language at the same level. Example conversion of Java program into C++</p><br>
			<p>In Java, the Just In Time Code generator converts the bytecode into the native machine code
				which are at the same programming levels.</p><br>
			<h3>In Java, the Just In Time Code generator converts the bytecode into the native machine code
				which are at the same programming levels.</h3><br>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Why is Java slow?</h2><br>
			<p>The two main reasons behind the slowness of Java are</p><br>
			<ol>
				<h3>
					<li>Dynamic Linking:</li>
				</h3>
				<p>Unlike C, linking is done at run-time, every time the program is run in Java.</p><br>
				<h3>
					<li>Run-time Interpreter:</li>
				</h3>
				<p>The conversion of byte code into native machine code is done at run-time in Java
					which furthers slows down the speed</p><br>
				<p>However, the latest version of Java has addressed the performance bottlenecks to a
					great extent.</p><br>
			</ol><br>
