			<h2>What is C++?</h2><br>
			<p>C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming language. It was created by Bjarne
				Stroustrup at Bell Labs circa 1980. C++ is very similar to C (invented by Dennis Ritchie
				in the early 1970s). C++ is so much compatible with C that it will probably compile over
				99% of C programs without changing a line of source code.</p><br>
			<p>Though, C++ is a lot well-structured and safer language than C as it OOPs based. C++ is a
				general-purpose language. It well deserves the widely acknowledged nickname "Swiss
				Pocket Knife of Languages."</p>
			<p>C++ is advanced version of <a href="c.html">C</a></p>

			<h2>5 Basic Concepts of C++.</h2><br>
			<dl>
				<dt>
					<h3>C++ Variables:</h3>
				</dt><br>
				<dd>
					<ul>
						<li>Variables are the backbone of any programming language.</li>
						<li>A variable is merely a way to store some information for later use.
							We can retrieve this value or data by referring to a "word" that
							will describe this information.</li>
						<li>Once declared and defined they may be used many times within the
							scope in which they were declared.</li>
					</ul>
				</dd><br>
				<dt>
					<h3>C++ Control Structures:</h3>
				</dt><br>
				<dd>
					<ul>
						<li>When a program runs, the code is read by the compiler line by line
							(from top to bottom, and for the most part left to right). This
							is known as "code flow."</li>
						<li>When the code is being read from top to bottom, it may encounter a
							point where it needs to make a decision. Based on the decision,
							the program may jump to a different part of the code. It may
							even make the compiler re-run a specific piece again, or just
							skip a bunch of code.</li>
						<li>You could think of this process like if you were to choose from
							different courses from Guru99. You decide, click a link and skip
							a few pages. In the same way, a computer program has a set of
							strict rules to decide the flow of program execution.</li>
					</ul>
				</dd><br>
				<dt>
					<h3>C++ Data Structures:</h3>
				</dt><br>
				<dd>
					<ul>
						<li>A data structure is a great way to get around having to create
							thousands of variables. C++ contains many types of inbuilt data
							structures. Most often used is arrays which will be taught
							later.</li>
					</ul>
				</dd><br>
				<dt>
					<h3>C++ Syntax:</h3>
				</dt><br>
				<dd>
					<ul>
						<li>The syntax is a layout of words, expression, and symbols.</li>
						<li>Syntax in a programming language is much the same. They are some
							well-defined set of rules that allow you to create some piece of
							well-functioning software.</li>
						<li>But, if you don't abide by the rules of a programming language or
							syntax, you'll get errors.</li>
					</ul>
				</dd><br>
				<dt>
					<h3>C++ Tools:</h3>
				</dt><br>
				<dd>
					<ul>
						<li>In the real world, a tool is something (usually a physical object)
							that helps you to get a certain job done promptly.Well, this
							holds true with the programming world too. A tool in programming
							is some piece of software which when used with the code allows
							you to program faster.</li>
						<li>Most crucial tool, considered by many, is an IDE, an Integrated
							Development Environment. An IDE is a software which will make
							your coding life so much easier. IDEs ensure that your files and
							folders are organized and give you a nice and clean way to view
							them.</li>
					</ul>

			<h2>A brief History of C++</h2><br>
			<p>The C++ language is an object-oriented programming language & is a combination of both
				low-level & high-level language – a Middle-Level Language. The programming language was
				created, designed & developed by a Danish Computer Scientist – Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell
				Telephone Laboratories (now known as Nokia Bell Labs) in Murray Hill, New Jersey. As he
				wanted a flexible & a dynamic language which was similar to C with all its features, but
				with additionality of active type checking, basic inheritance, default functioning
				argument, classes, inlining, etc. and hence C with Classes (C++) was launched.</p><br>
			<p>C++ was initially known as “C with classes, ” and was renamed C++ in 1983. ++ is shorthand
				for adding one to variety in programming; therefore C++ roughly means that “one higher
				than C.”</p><br>

			<h2>Variable Types</h2><br>
			<p>C++ defines a whole set of primitive types:</p><br>
			<ol>
				<li>Void Type</li>
				<li>Arithemetic Type
					<ul>
						<li>Floating-point types:</li>
						<p> The float (or floating type) represent decimal numbers. The IEEE
							standard specifies a minimum number of significant digits. Most
							compilers usually provide more precision than the specified
							minimum. Typically, floats are represented in by 32bits, doubles
							in 64 bits, and long doubles in either 96 or 128 bits.</p>
						<li>Integer types:
							<p>The Boolean type has only two types of values: True or False.
								There are several char types, most of which exist to
								support internationalization. The most basic character
								type is char. A char is the same size as a single
								machine byte meaning a single byte.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Signed Type:</li>
								<p>They represent negative or positive numbers
									(including zero). In a signed type, the range
									must be evenly divided between +ve and -ve
									values. Thus, an 8-bit signed char will hold
									values from –127 through 127.</p>
								<li>Unsigned Type:</li>
								<p>In an unsigned type, all values are >= 0. An 8-bit
									unsigned char can contain 0 through 255 (both
									inclusive).</p>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

			<h3>Variable Name or Identifiers</h3><br>
			<p>Identifiers can be composed of some letters, digits, and the underscore character or some
				combination of them. No limit is imposed on name length.</p><br>
			<p>Identifiers must;</p><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Begin with either a letter or an underscore ('_').</li>
				<li>Are case-sensitive; upper and lowercase letters are distinct:</li>
			</ul><br>
			<p>The C++ language has reserved some names for its use.</p><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/c++3.png" width="80%" alt="C++ subfields">

		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Register Variables:</h3><br>
			<p>Registers variables are faster to access compared to memory variables. So, variables which
				are frequently used in a C++ program can be put in registers using register keyword. The
				register keyword tells the compiler to store the given variable in a register. It's
				compiler's choice whether to put it in a register or not. Generally, compilers
				themselves do various optimizations which include putting some of the variables in the
				register. There is no limit on the number of register variables in a C++ program. But
				the compiler may not store the variable in a register. This is because register memory
				is very limited and is most generally used by the OS.</p><br>
			<p>To define: register int i;</p><br>
			<h3>Comments</h3>
			<p>Comments are the portions of the code ignored by the compiler. It allows the programmer to
				make notes in the relevant areas of the source code/program. Comments come either in
				block form or single lines. The program comments are explanatory statements. It can be
				included in the C++ code which helps anyone reading its source code. All programming
				languages allow some form of comments. C++ supports both single-line and multi-line
				comments.</p><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Single-line comments:</li>
				<p>The ones which start with // and continue until the end of the line. If the last
					character in a comment line is a \ then the comment will continue in the next
					line.</p>
				<li>Multi-line comments:</li>
				<p>The ones which start with /* and end with */.</p>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Concept of Classes/Objects:</h2><br>
			<p>Everything in C++ is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and
				methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as
				weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.</p><br>
			<p>Attributes and methods are basically variables and functions</p><br>
			<p>A class is a user-defined data type that we can use in our program, and it works as an object
				constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.</p><br>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Class Methods:</h4><br>
			<p>Methods are functions that belongs to the class.</p><br>
			<p>There are two ways to define functions that belongs to a class:</p><br>
			<ol>
				<li>Inside class definition</li>
				<p>To define a function inside the class definition, you have to declare it inside the
					class and then define it inside of the class. This is done by specifiying the
					name of the function</p><br>
				<li>Outside class definition</li>
				<p>To define a function outside the class definition, you have to declare it inside the
					class and then define it outside of the class. This is done by specifiying the
					name of the class, followed the scope resolution :: operator, followed by the
					name of the function</p>
			</ol><br>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Constructors:</h4><br>
			<p>A constructor in C++ is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a
				class is created.</p>
			<p>To create a constructor, use the same name as the class, followed by parentheses ():</p><br>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Encapsulation:</h4><br>
			<p>The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To
				achieve this, you must declare class variables/attributes as private (cannot be accessed
				from outside the class). If you want others to read or modify the value of a private
				member, you can provide public get and set methods.</p>
			<p>To create a constructor, use the same name as the class, followed by parentheses ():</p><br>
			<h4>Who can Access Data:</h4><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/c++4.jpg" width="80%" alt="C++ subfields">
			</figure><br>
			<h4>Why Encapsulation?</h4><br>
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li>It is considered good practice to declare your class attributes as private.
					Encapsulation ensures better control of your data, because you (or others) can
					change one part of the code without affecting other parts</li>
			</ul>
			</p><br>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Inheritance:</h4><br>
			<p>In C++, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another.</p>
			<p>We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:</p><br>
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Derived class(child)</li>
				<p>The class that inherits from another class</p>
				<li>Base class(parent)</li>
				<p>The class being inherited from</p>
			</ul>
			</p><br>
			<h4>Why And When To Use "Inheritance"?</h4><br>
			<p>It is useful for code reusability: reuse attributes and methods of an existing class when you
				create a new class.</p>
