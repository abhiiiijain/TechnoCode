			<h2>What is C programming?</h2><br>
			<p>C is a general-purpose programming language that is extremely popular, simple and flexible.
				It is machine-independent, structured programming language which is used extensively in
				various applications.</p><br>
			<p>C was the basic language to write everything from operating systems (Windows and many others)
				to complex programs like the Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter and more.</p>
			<p>It is said that 'C' is a god's programming language. One can say, C is a base for the
				programming. If you know 'C,' you can easily grasp the knowledge of the other
				programming languages that uses the concept of 'C'</p>

			<h2>A brief History of C language</h2><br>
			<p>The base or father of programming languages is 'ALGOL.' It was first introduced in 1960.
				'ALGOL' was used on a large basis in European countries. 'ALGOL' introduced the concept
				of structured programming to the developer community. In 1967, a new computer
				programming language was announced called as 'BCPL' which stands for Basic Combined
				Programming Language. BCPL was designed and developed by Martin Richards, especially for
				writing system software. This was the era of programming languages. Just after three
				years, in 1970 a new programming language called 'B' was introduced by Ken Thompson that
				contained multiple features of 'BCPL.' This programming language was created using UNIX
				operating system at AT&T and Bell Laboratories. Both the 'BCPL' and 'B' were system
				programming languages.</p><br>
			<p>In 1972, a great computer scientist Dennis Ritchie created a new programming language called
				'C' at the Bell Laboratories. It was created from 'ALGOL', 'BCPL' and 'B' programming
				languages. 'C' programming language contains all the features of these languages and
				many more additional concepts that make it unique from other languages.</p><br>
			<p>'C' is a powerful programming language which is strongly associated with the UNIX operating
				system. Even most of the UNIX operating system is coded in 'C'. Initially 'C'
				programming was limited to the UNIX operating system, but as it started spreading around
				the world, it became commercial, and many compilers were released for cross-platform
				systems. Today 'C' runs under a variety of operating systems and hardware platforms. As
				it started evolving many different versions of the language were released. At times it
				became difficult for the developers to keep up with the latest version as the systems
				were running under the older versions. To assure that 'C' language will remain standard,
				American National Standards Institute (ANSI) defined a commercial standard for 'C'
				language in 1989. Later, it was approved by the International Standards Organization
				(ISO) in 1990. 'C' programming language is also called as 'ANSI C'.</p><br>
			<p>Languages such as C++/Java are developed from 'C'. These languages are widely used in various
				technologies. Thus, 'C' forms a base for many other languages that are currently in use.

			<h2>Why learn 'C'?</h2><br>
			<p>As we studied earlier, 'C' is a base language for many programming languages. So, learning
				'C' as the main language will play an important role while studying other programming
				languages. It shares the same concepts such as data types, operators, control statements
				and many more. 'C' can be used widely in various applications. It is a simple language
				and provides faster execution. There are many jobs available for a 'C' developer in the
				current market.</p><br>
			<p>'C' is a structured programming language in which program is divided into various modules.
				Each module can be written separately and together it forms a single 'C' program. This
				structure makes it easy for testing, maintaining and debugging processes.</p><br>
			<p>'C' contains 32 keywords, various data types and a set of powerful built-in functions that
				make programming very efficient.</p><br>
			<p>Another feature of 'C' programming is that it can extend itself. A 'C' program contains
				various functions which are part of a library. We can add our features and functions to
				the library. We can access and use these functions anytime we want in our program. This
				feature makes it simple while working with complex programming.</p><br>
			<p>Various compilers are available in the market that can be used for executing programs written
				in this language.</p><br>
			<p>It is a highly portable language which means programs written in 'C' language can run on
				other machines. This feature is essential if we wish to use or execute the code on
				another computer.</p><br>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>How 'C' Works?</h2><br>
			<p>C is a compiled language. A compiler is a special tool that compiles the program and converts
				it into the object file which is machine readable. After the compilation process, the
				linker will combine different object files and creates a single executable file to run
				the program. The following diagram shows the execution of a 'C' program.</p><br>
			<p>Nowadays, various compilers are available online, and you can use any of those compilers. The
				functionality will never differ and most of the compilers will provide the features
				required to execute both 'C' and 'C++' programs.</p><br>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>C Tokens, Keywords, Identifiers</h2><br>
			<h3>What is a Character set?</h3><br>
			<p>Like every other language, 'C' also has its own character set. A program is a set of
				instructions that, when executed, generate an output. The data that is processed by a
				program consists of various characters and symbols. The output generated is also a
				combination of characters and symbols.</p><br>
			<p>A character set in 'C' is divided into,</p><br>
			<ol>
				<li>Letters
					<ul>
						<li>Uppercase characters (A-Z)</li>
						<li>Lowercase characters (a-z)</li>
					</ul>
				</li><br>
				<li>Numbers
					<ul>
						<li>All the digits from 0 to 9</li>
					</ul>
				</li><br>
				<li>Special Characters
					<ul>
						<li>Blank Spaces</li>
						<li>New Line</li>
						<li>Carriage return</li>
						<li>Horizontal tab</li>
					</ul>
				</li><br>
				<li>White Spaces(Blank Spaces)

			<h3>What is Token in C?</h3><br>
			<p>TOKEN is the smallest unit in a 'C' program. It is each and every word and punctuation that
				you come across in your C program. The compiler breaks a program into the smallest
				possible units (tokens) and proceeds to the various stages of the compilation. A token
				is divided into six different types, viz, Keywords, Operators, Strings, Constants,
				Special Characters, and Identifiers.</p><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/c3.png" width="80%" alt="C++ subfields">
			</figure><br>
			<h3>Keywords and Identifiers</h3><br>
			<p>In 'C' every word can be either a keyword or an identifier.Keywords have fixed meanings, and
				the meaning cannot be changed. They act as a building block of a 'C' program. There are
				a total of 32 keywords in 'C'. Keywords are written in lowercase letters.</p><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/c4.png" width="80%" alt="C++ subfields">
			</figure><br>
			<p>An identifier is nothing but a name assigned to an element in a program. Example, name of a
				variable, function, etc. Identifiers are the user-defined names consisting of 'C'
				standard character set. As the name says, identifiers are used to identify a particular
				element in a program. Each identifier must have a unique name.</p><br>
			<p>
			<h4>Following rules must be followed for identifiers:</h4><br>
			<ol>
				<li>The first character must always be an alphabet or an underscore.</li>
				<li>It should be formed using only letters, numbers, or underscore.</li>
				<li>A keyword cannot be used as an identifier.</li>
				<li>It should not contain any whitespace character.</li>
				<li>The name must be meaningful.</li>
			</ol>
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>C Variable, Datatypes, Constants</h2><br>
			<h3>What is a Variable?</h3><br>
			<p>A variable is an identifier which is used to store some value. Constants can never change at
				the time of execution. Variables can change during the execution of a program and update
				the value stored inside it.</p><br>
			<p>A single variable can be used at multiple locations in a program. A variable name must be
				meaningful. It should represent the purpose of the variable.</p><br>
			<p>A variable must be declared first before it is used somewhere inside the program. A variable
				name is formed using characters, digits and an underscore.</p><br>
			<h4>Following are the rules that must be followed while creating a variable:</h4><br>
			<p>
			<ol>
				<li>A variable name should consist of only characters, digits and an underscore.</li>
				<li>A variable name should not begin with a number.</li>
				<li>A variable name should not consist of whitespace.</li>
				<li>A variable name should not consist of a keyword.</li>
				<li>'C' is a case sensitive language that means a variable named 'age' and 'AGE' are
					different.</li><br>
			</ol>
			</p>
			<h3>Data Types</h3><br>
			<p>'C' provides various data types to make it easy for a programmer to select a suitable data
				type as per the requirements of an application. Following are the three data types:</p>
			<br>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h4>Primary fundamental data types</h4>
					<ol type="i">
						<li>int for integer data</li>
						<li>char for character data</li>
						<li>float for floating point numbers</li>
						<li>double for double precision floating point numbers</li>
						<li>void</li>
					</ol>
				</li><br>
				<li>
					<h4>Derived data types</h4>
					<ol type="i">
						<li>Array</li>
						<li>Pointers</li>
						<li>Structures</li>
					</ol>
				</li><br>
				<li>
					<h4>User-Defined data typed</h4>
				</li>
			</ol>
			</p>

			<h2>Conditional Statement</h2><br>
			<p>In a 'C' program are executed sequentially. This happens when there is no condition around
				the statements. If you put some condition for a block of statements the flow of
				execution might change based on the result evaluated by the condition. This process is
				referred to as decision making in 'C.' The decision-making statements are also called as
				control statements.</p><br>
			<p>In 'C' programming conditional statements are possible with the help of the following two
				constructs:</p><br>
			<ol>
				<h3>
					<li>If Statement</li>
				</h3>
				<h3>
					<li>If-else Statement</li>
				</h3>
			</ol>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Loops</h2><br>
			<p>A Loop executes the sequence of statements many times until the stated condition becomes
				false. A loop consists of two parts, a body of a loop and a control statement. The
				control statement is a combination of some conditions that direct the body of the loop
				to execute until the specified condition becomes false. The purpose of the loop is to
				repeat the same code a number of times.</p><br>
			<p>In 'C' programming loops are possible with the help of the following three constructs:</p>
			<br>
			<ol>
				<h3>
					<li>While loop</li>
					<li>Do-while loop</li>
					<li>For loop</li>
				</h3>
			</ol>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Switch Case Statement</h2><br>
			<p>Switch statement tests the value of a variable and compares it with multiple cases. Once the
				case match is found, a block of statements associated with that particular case is
				executed.</p><br>
			<p>Each case in a block of a switch has a different name/number which is referred to as an
				identifier. The value provided by the user is compared with all the cases inside the
				switch block until the match is found.</p><br>
			<p>If a case match is NOT found, then the default statement is executed, and the control goes
				out of the switch block.</p><br>
			<p>In 'C' programming switch is possible with the help of the following constructs:</p><br>
			<ol>
				<h3>
					<li>Switch</li>
				</h3>
			</ol>
