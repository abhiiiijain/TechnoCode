			<h2>What is Cyber Security?</h2><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/cs.jpg" width="90%" alt="Cyber Security">
			</figure><br>
			<p>Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic
				systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information
				technology security or electronic information security. The term applies in a variety of
				contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be divided into a few common
				categories.</p><br>
			<ul>
				<li> <b>Network security</b> is the practice of securing a computer network from
					intruders, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware.</li><br>
				<li><b>Application security</b> focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats.
					A compromised application could provide access to the data its designed to
					protect. Successful security begins in the design stage, well before a program
					or device is deployed.</li><br>
				<li><b>Information security</b> protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in
					storage and in transit.</li><br>
				<li><b>Operational security</b> includes the processes and decisions for handling and
					protecting data assets. The permissions users have when accessing a network and
					the procedures that determine how and where data may be stored or shared all
					fall under this umbrella.</li><br>
				<li><b>Disaster recovery and business continuity</b> define how an organization responds
					to a cyber-security incident or any other event that causes the loss of
					operations or data. Disaster recovery policies dictate how the organization
					restores its operations and information to return to the same operating capacity
					as before the event. Business continuity is the plan the organization falls back
					on while trying to operate without certain resources.</li><br>
				<li><b>End-user education</b> addresses the most unpredictable cyber-security factor:
					people. Anyone can accidentally introduce a virus to an otherwise secure system
					by failing to follow good security practices. Teaching users to delete
					suspicious email attachments, not plug in unidentified USB drives, and various
					other important lessons is vital for the security of any organization.</li>

			<h2>The scale of the cyber threat</h2><br>
			<p>The global cyber threat continues to evolve at a rapid pace, with a rising number of data
				breaches each year. A report by RiskBased Security revealed that a shocking 7.9 billion
				records have been exposed by data breaches in the first nine months of 2019 alone. This
				figure is more than double (112%) the number of records exposed in the same period in
				2018.</p><br>
			<p>Medical services, retailers and public entities experienced the most breaches, with malicious
				criminals responsible for most incidents. Some of these sectors are more appealing to
				cybercriminals because they collect financial and medical data, but all businesses that
				use networks can be targeted for customer data, corporate espionage, or customer
				attacks.</p><br>
			<p>With the scale of the cyber threat set to continue to rise, the International Data
				Corporation predicts that worldwide spending on cyber-security solutions will reach a
				massive $133.7 billion by 2022. Governments across the globe have responded to the
				rising cyber threat with guidance to help organizations implement effective
				cyber-security practices.</p><br>
			<p>In the U.S., the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has created a
				cyber-security framework. To combat the proliferation of malicious code and aid in early
				detection, the framework recommends continuous, real-time monitoring of all electronic
				resources.</p><br>
			<p>The importance of system monitoring is echoed in the “10 steps to cyber security”, guidance
				provided by the U.K. government’s National Cyber Security Centre. In Australia, The
				Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) regularly publishes guidance on how
				organizations can counter the latest cyber-security threats. </p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Types of cyber threats</h2><br>
			<p>The threats countered by cyber-security are three-fold:</p><br>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h4>Cybercrime</h4><br> includes single actors or groups targeting systems for
					financial gain or to cause disruption.
				</li><br>
				<li>
					<h4>Cyber-attack</h4><br> often involves politically motivated information
					gathering.
				</li><br>
				<li>
					<h4>Cyberterrorism</h4><br> is intended to undermine electronic systems to cause
					panic or fear.
				</li>
			</ol><br>
			<p>So, how do malicious actors gain control of computer systems? Here are some common methods
				used to threaten cyber-security</p><br>
			<h3>Malware</h3><br>
			<p>Malware means malicious software. One of the most common cyber threats, malware is software
				that a cybercriminal or hacker has created to disrupt or damage a legitimate user’s
				computer. Often spread via an unsolicited email attachment or legitimate-looking
				download, malware may be used by cybercriminals to make money or in politically
				motivated cyber-attacks.<br><br>
				There are a number of different types of malware, including:</p><br>
			<dl>
				<dt>
					<h4>Virus:</h4>
				</dt><br>
				<dd> A self-replicating program that attaches itself to clean file and spreads
					throughout a computer system, infecting files with malicious code.</dd><br>
				<dt>
					<h4>Trojans:</h4>
				</dt><br>
				<dd>A type of malware that is disguised as legitimate software. Cybercriminals trick
					users into uploading Trojans onto their computer where they cause damage or
					collect data.</dd><br>
				<dt>
					<h4>Spyware</h4>
				</dt><br>
				<dd>A program that secretly records what a user does, so that cybercriminals can make
					use of this information. For example, spyware could capture credit card details.
				</dd><br>
				<dt>
					<h4>Ransomware:</h4>
				</dt><br>
				<dd> Malware which locks down a user’s files and data, with the threat of erasing it
					unless a ransom is paid.</dd><br>
				<dt>
					<h4>Adware</h4>
				</dt><br>
				<dd>Advertising software which can be used to spread malware.</dd><br>
				<dt>
					<h4>Botnets</h4>
				</dt><br>
				<dd> Networks of malware infected computers which cybercriminals use to perform tasks
					online without the user’s permission.</dd><br>
			</dl>
			<h4>QL injection</h4><br>
			<p>An SQL (structured language query) injection is a type of cyber-attack used to take control
				of and steal data from a database. Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in data-driven
				applications to insert malicious code into a databased via a malicious SQL statement.
				This gives them access to the sensitive information contained in the database.</p><br>
			<h4>Phishing</h4><br>
			<p>Phishing is when cybercriminals target victims with emails that appear to be from a
				legitimate company asking for sensitive information. Phishing attacks are often used to
				dupe people into handing over credit card data and other personal information.</p><br>
			<h4>Man-in-the-middle attack</h4><br>
			<p>A man-in-the-middle attack is a type of cyber threat where a cybercriminal intercepts
				communication between two individuals in order to steal data. For example, on an
				unsecure WiFi network, an attacker could intercept data being passed from the victim’s
				device and the network.</p><br>
			<h4>Denial-of-service attack</h4><br>
			<p>A denial-of-service attack is where cybercriminals prevent a computer system from fulfilling
				legitimate requests by overwhelming the networks and servers with traffic. This renders
				the system unusable, preventing an organization from carrying out vital functions.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Latest cyber threats</h3><br>
			<p>What are the latest cyber threats that individuals and organizations need to guard against?
				Here are some of the most recent cyber threats that the U.K., U.S., and Australian
				governments have reported on.</p><br>
			<h4>Dridex malware</h4><br>
			<p>In December 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) charged the leader of an organized
				cyber-criminal group for their part in a global Dridex malware attack. This malicious
				campaign affected the public, government, infrastructure and business worldwide.</p><br>
			<p>Dridex is a financial trojan with a range of capabilities. Affecting victims since 2014, it
				infects computers though phishing emails or existing malware. Capable of stealing
				passwords, banking details and personal data which can be used in fraudulent
				transactions, it has caused massive financial losses amounting to hundreds of millions.
			</p><br>
			<p>In response to the Dridex attacks, the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre advises the
				public to “ensure devices are patched, anti-virus is turned on and up to date and files
				are backed up”.</p><br>
			<h4>Romance scams</h4><br>
			<p>In February 2020, the FBI warned U.S. citizens to be aware of confidence fraud that
				cybercriminals commit using dating sites, chat rooms and apps. Perpetrators take
				advantage of people seeking new partners, duping victims into giving away personal data.
			</p><br>
			<p>The FBI reports that romance cyber threats affected 114 victims in New Mexico in 2019, with
				financial losses amounting to $1.6 million.</p><br>
			<h4>Emotet malware</h4><br>
			<p>In late 2019, The Australian Cyber Security Centre warned national organizations about a
				widespread global cyber threat from Emotet malware.</p><br>
			<p>Emotet is a sophisticated trojan that can steal data and also load other malware. Emotet
				thrives on unsophisticated password: a reminder of the importance of creating a secure
				password to guard against cyber threats.</p>

			<h2>End-user protection</h2><br>
			<p>End-user protection or endpoint security is a crucial aspect of cyber security. After all, it
				is often an individual (the end-user) who accidentally uploads malware or another form
				of cyber threat to their desktop, laptop or mobile device.</p><br>
			<p>So, how do cyber-security measures protect end users and systems? First, cyber-security
				relies on cryptographic protocols to encrypt emails, files, and other critical data.
				This not only protects information in transit, but also guards against loss or theft.
			</p><br>
			<p>In addition, end-user security software scans computers for pieces of malicious code,
				quarantines this code, and then removes it from the machine. Security programs can even
				detect and remove malicious code hidden in Master Boot Record (MBR) and are designed to
				encrypt or wipe data from computer’s hard drive.</p><br>
			<p>Electronic security protocols also focus on real-time malware detection. Many use heuristic
				and behavioral analysis to monitor the behavior of a program and its code to defend
				against viruses or Trojans that change their shape with each execution (polymorphic and
				metamorphic malware). Security programs can confine potentially malicious programs to a
				virtual bubble separate from a user's network to analyze their behavior and learn how to
				better detect new infections.</p><br>
			<p>Security programs continue to evolve new defenses as cyber-security professionals identify
				new threats and new ways to combat them. To make the most of end-user security software,
				employees need to be educated about how to use it. Crucially, keeping it running and
				updating it frequently ensures that it can protect users against the latest cyber
				threats.</p>
