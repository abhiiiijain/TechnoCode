			<h2>What is Cloud Computing?</h2><br>
			<p>Cloud Computing can be defined as delivering computing power( CPU, RAM, Network Speeds,
				Storage OS software) a service over a network (usually on the internet) rather than
				physically having the computing resources at the customer location.</p><br>
			<p><b>Example:</b> AWS, Azure, Google Cloud</p><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/cc.jpg" width="90%" alt="Cloud Computing">
			</figure><br>
			<p>Let’s learn Cloud computing with an example -</p><br>
			<p>Whenever you travel through a bus or train, you take a ticket for your destination and hold
				back to your seat till you reach your destination. Likewise other passengers also takes
				ticket and travel in the same bus with you and it hardly bothers you where they go. When
				your stop comes you get off the bus thanking the driver. Cloud computing is just like
				that bus, carrying data and information for different users and allows to use its
				service with minimal cost.</p>

			<h2>Why Cloud Computing?</h2><br>
			<p>With increase in computer and Mobile user’s, data storage has become a priority in all
				fields. Large and small scale businesses today thrive on their data & they spent a huge
				amount of money to maintain this data. It requires a strong IT support and a storage
				hub. Not all businesses can afford high cost of in-house IT infrastructure and back up
				support services. For them Cloud Computing is a cheaper solution. Perhaps its efficiency
				in storing data, computation and less maintenance cost has succeeded to attract even
				bigger businesses as well.</p><br>
			<p>Cloud computing decreases the hardware and software demand from the user’s side. The only
				thing that user must be able to run is the cloud computing systems interface software,
				which can be as simple as Web browser, and the Cloud network takes care of the rest. We
				all have experienced cloud computing at some instant of time, some of the popular cloud
				services we have used or we are still using are mail services like gmail, hotmail or
				yahoo etc.</p><br>
			<p>While accessing e-mail service our data is stored on cloud server and not on our computer.
				The technology and infrastructure behind the cloud is invisible. It is less important
				whether cloud services are based on HTTP, XML, Ruby, PHP or other specific technologies
				as far as it is user friendly and functional. An individual user can connect to cloud
				system from his/her own devices like desktop, laptop or mobile.</p><br>
			<p>Cloud computing harnesses small business effectively having limited resources, it gives small
				businesses access to the technologies that previously were out of their reach. Cloud
				computing helps small businesses to convert their maintenance cost into profit. Let’s
				see how?</p><br>
			<p>In an in-house IT server, you have to pay a lot of attention and ensure that there are no
				flaws into the system so that it runs smoothly. And in case of any technical glitch you
				are completely responsible; it will seek a lot of attention, time and money for repair.
				Whereas, in cloud computing, the service provider takes the complete responsibility of
				the complication and the technical faults.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Benefits of Cloud Computing</h2><br>
			<p>The potential for cost saving is the major reason of cloud services adoption by many
				organizations. Cloud computing gives the freedom to use services as per the requirement
				and pay only for what you use. Due to cloud computing it has become possible to run IT
				operations as a outsourced unit without much in-house resources.</p><br>
			<p>Following are the benefits of cloud computing:</p><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Lower IT infrastructure and computer costs for users</li>
				<li>Improved performance</li>
				<li>Fewer Maintenance issues</li>
				<li>Instant software updates</li>
				<li>Improved compatibility between Operating systems</li>
				<li>Backup and recovery</li>
				<li>Performance and Scalability</li>
				<li>Increased storage capacity</li>
				<li>Increase data safety</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Types of Clouds</h2><br>
			<p>There are four different cloud models that you can subscribe according to business needs:</p>
			<br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/cc3.jpg" width="90%" alt="Types Of Cloud">
			</figure><br>
			<dl>
				<dt>
					<h3>Private Cloud: </h3>
				</dt><br>
				<dd>Here, computing resources are deployed for one particular organization. This method
					is more used for intra-business interactions. Where the computing resources can
					be governed, owned and operated by the same organization.</dd><br>
				<dt>
					<h3>Community Cloud: </h3>
				</dt><br>
				<dd>Here, computing resources are provided for a community and organizations. </dd><br>
				<dt>
					<h3>Public Cloud: </h3>
				</dt><br>
				<dd>This type of cloud is used usually for B2C (Business to Consumer) type interactions.
					Here the computing resource is owned, governed and operated by government, an
					academic or business organization. </dd><br>
				<dt>
					<h3>Hybrid Cloud:</h3>
				</dt><br>
				<dd>This type of cloud can be used for both type of interactions - B2B (Business to
					Business) or B2C ( Business to Consumer). This deployment method is called
					hybrid cloud as the computing resources are bound together by different clouds.
				</dd>
			</dl>

			<h2>Cloud Computing Services</h2><br>
			<p>The three major Cloud Computing Offerings are</p><br>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Software as a Service (SaaS)</b></li>
				<li><b>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</b></li>
				<li><b>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</b></li>
			</ul><br>
			<p>Different business use some or all of these components according to their requirement.</p>
			<br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/cc4.jpg" width="90%" alt="Cloud Computing Services">
			</figure><br>
			<h3>SaaS (Software as a Service)</h3><br>
			<p>SaaS or software as a service is a software distribution model in which applications are
				hosted by a vendor or service provider and made available to customers over a network
				(internet). SaaS is becoming an increasingly prevalent delivery model as underlying
				technologies that supports Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) or Web Services. Through
				internet this service is available to users anywhere in the world. </p><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/cc5.jpg" width="90%" alt="SaaS">
			</figure><br>
			<p>Traditionaly, software application needed to be purchased upfront &then installed it onto
				your computer. SaaS users on the other hand, instead of purchasing the software
				subscribes to it, usually on monthly basisvia internet4.</p><br>
			<p>Anyone who needs an access to a particular piece of software can be subscribe as a user,
				whether it is one or two people or every thousands of employees in a corporation. SaaS
				is compatible with all internet enabled devices.</p><br>
			<p>Many important tasks like accounting, sales, invoicing and planning all can be performed
				using SaaS.</p><br>
			<h3>PaaS (Platform as a Service)</h3><br>
			<p>Platform as a service, is referred as PaaS, it provides a platform and environment to allow
				developers to build applications and services. This service is hosted in the cloud and
				accessed by the users via internet</p><br>
			<p>To understand in a simple terms, let compare this with painting a picture, where you are
				provided with paint colors, different paint brushes and paper by your school teacher and
				you just have to draw a beautiful picture using those tools. </p><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/cc6.jpg" width="90%" alt="PaaS">
			</figure>
			<p>PaaS services are constantly updated & new features added. Software developers, web
				developers and business can benefit from PaaS. It provides platform to support
				application development. It includes software support and management services, storage,
				networking, deploying, testing, collaborating, hosting and maintaining applications.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)</h3><br>
			<p>IaaS (Infrastructure As A Service) is one of the fundamental service model of cloud computing
				alongside PaaS( Platform as a Service). It provides access to computing resources in a
				virtualized environment “the cloud” on internet. It provides computing infrastructure
				like virtual server space, network connections, bandwidth, load balancers and IP
				addresses. The pool of hardware resource is extracted from multiple servers and networks
				usually distributed across numerous data centers. This provides redundancy and
				reliability to IaaS.</p><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/cc7.jpg" width="90%" alt="IaaS">
			</figure>
			<p>IaaS(Infrastructure as a service) is a complete package for computing. For small scale
				businesses who are looking for cutting cost on IT infrastructure, IaaS is one of the
				solutions. Annually a lot of money is spent in maintenance and buying new components
				like hard-drives, network connections, external storage device etc. which a business
				owner could have saved for other expenses by using IaaS.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>What is Cloud Computing Architecture?</h2><br>
			<p>Let’s have a look into Cloud Computing and see what Cloud Computing is made of. Cloud
				computing comprises of two components front end and back end. Front end consist client
				part of cloud computing system. It comprise of interfaces and applications that are
				required to access the cloud computing platform.</p><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/cc8.jpg" width="90%" alt="Cloud Computing Architecture">
			</figure><br>
			<p>While back end refers to the cloud itself, it comprises of the resources that are required
				for cloud computing services. It consists of virtual machines, servers, data storage,
				security mechanism etc. It is under providers control.</p><br>
			<p>Cloud computing distributes the file system that spreads over multiple hard disks and
				machines. Data is never stored in one place only and in case one unit fails the other
				will take over automatically. The user disk space is allocated on the distributed file
				system, while another important component is algorithm for resource allocation. Cloud
				computing is a strong distributed environment and it heavily depends upon strong
				algorithm.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Virtualization and Cloud Computing</h2><br>
			<p>The main enabling technology for Cloud Computing is Virtualization. Virtualization is a
				partitioning of single physical server into multiple logical servers. Once the physical
				server is divided, each logical server behaves like a physical server and can run an
				operating system and applications independently. Many popular companies’s like VmWare
				and Microsoft provide virtualization services, where instead of using your personal PC
				for storage and computation, you use their virtual server. They are fast, cost-effective
				and less time consuming.</p><br>
			<p>For software developers and testers virtualization comes very handy, as it allows developer
				to write code that runs in many different environments and more importantly to test that
				code.</p><br>
			<p>Virtualization is mainly used for three main purposes 1) Network Virtualization 2) Server
				Virtualization 3) Storage Virtualization</p><br>
			<p>Network Virtualization: It is a method of combining the available resources in a network by
				splitting up the available bandwidth into channels, each of which is independent from
				the others and each channel is independent of others and can be assigned to a specific
				server or device in real time.</p><br>
			<p>Storage Virtualization: It is the pooling of physical storage from multiple network storage
				devices into what appears to be a single storage device that is managed from a central
				console. Storage virtualization is commonly used in storage area networks (SANs).</p>
			<br>
			<p>Server Virtualization: Server virtualization is the masking of server resources like
				processors, RAM, operating system etc, from server users. The intention of server
				virtualization is to increase the resource sharing and reduce the burden and complexity
				of computation from users.</p><br>
			<p>Virtualization is the key to unlock the Cloud system, what makes virtualization so important
				for the cloud is that it decouples the software from the hardware. For example, PC’s can
				use virtual memory to borrow extra memory from the hard disk. Usually hard disk has a
				lot more space than memory. Although virtual disks are slower than real memory, if
				managed properly the substitution works perfectly. Likewise, there is software which can
				imitate an entire computer, which means 1 computer can perform the functions equals to
				20 computers.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Grid Computing Vs Cloud Computing</h2><br>
			<p>When we switch on the fan or any electric device, we are less concern about the power supply
				from where it comes and how it is generated. The power supply or electricity that we
				receives at our home travels through a chain of network, which includes power stations,
				transformers, power lines and transmission stations. These components together make a
				‘Power Grid’. Likewise, ‘Grid Computing’ is an infrastructure that links computing
				resources such as PCs, servers, workstations and storage elements and provides the
				mechanism required to access them.</p><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/cc9.jpg" width="90%" alt="Grid Computing">
			</figure><br>
			<p>Grid Computing is a middle ware to co-ordinate disparate IT resources across a network,
				allowing them to function as whole. It is more often used in scientific research and in
				universities for educational purpose. For example, a group of architect students working
				on a different project requires a specific designing tool and a software for designing
				purpose but only couple of them got access to this designing tool, the problem is how
				they can make this tool available to rest of the students. To make available for other
				students they will put this designing tool on campus network, now the grid will connect
				all these computers in campus network and allow student to use designing tool required
				for their project from anywhere.</p><br>
			<p>Cloud computing and Grid computing is often confused, though there functions are almost
				similar there approach for their functionality is different. Let see how they operate-
			</p><br>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Cloud Computing</th>
					<th>Grid Computing</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Cloud computing works more as a service provider for utilizing computer
						resource</td>
					<td>Grid computing uses the available resource and interconnected computer
						systems to accomplish a common goal</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Cloud computing is a centralized model</td>
					<td>Grid computing is a decentralized model, where the computation could occur
						over many administrative model</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Cloud is a collection of computers usually owned by a single party.</td>
					<td>A grid is a collection of computers which is owned by a multiple parties in
						multiple locations and connected together so that users can share the
						combined power of resources</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Cloud offers more services all most all the services like web hosting, DB
						(Data Base) support and much more</td>
					<td>Grid provides limited services</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Cloud computing is typically provided within a single organization (eg :
						Amazon)</td>
					<td>Grid computing federates the resources located within different
						organization.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Utility Computing Vs Cloud Computing</h2><br>
			<p>In our previous conversation in “Grid Computing” we have seen how electricity is supplied to
				our house, also we do know that to keep electricity supply we have to pay the bill.
				Utility Computing is just like that, we use electricity at home as per our requirement
				and pay the bill accordingly likewise you will use the services for the computing and
				pay as per the use this is known as ‘Utility computing’. Utility computing is a good
				source for small scale usage, it can be done in any server environment and requires
				Cloud Computing.</p><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/cc10.jpg" width="90% alt=" Utility Computinng vs Cloud Computing>
			</figure><br>
			<p>Utility computing is the process of providing service through an on-demand, pay per use
				billing method. The customer or client has access to a virtually unlimited supply of
				computing solutions over a virtual private network or over the internet, which can be
				sourced and used whenever it’s required. Based on the concept of utility computing ,
				grid computing, cloud computing and managed IT services are based.</p><br>
			<p>Through utility computing small businesses with limited budget can easily use software like
				CRM (Customer Relationship Management) without investing heavily on infrastructure to
				maintain their clientele base.</p><br>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Utility Computing</th>
					<th>Cloud Computing</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Utility computing refers to the ability to charge the offered services, and
						charge customers for exact usage</td>
					<td>Cloud Computing also works like utility computing, you pay only for what you
						use but Cloud Computing might be cheaper, as such, Cloud based app can
						be up and running in days or weeks.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Utility computing users want to be in control of the geographical location
						of the infrastructure</td>
					<td>In cloud computing, provider is in complete control of cloud computing
						services and infrastructure</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Utility computing is more favorable when performance and selection
						infrastructure is critical</td>
					<td>Cloud computing is great and easy to use when the selection infrastructure
						and performance is not critical</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Utility computing is a good choice for less resource demanding</td>
					<td>Cloud computing is a good choice for high resource demanding</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Utility computing refers to a business model</td>
					<td>Cloud computing refers to the underlying IT architecture</td>
				</tr>

			<h2>Security concerns for Cloud Computing</h2><br>
			<p>While using cloud computing, the major issue that concerns the users is about its security.
			</p><br>
			<p>One concern is that cloud providers themselves may have access to customer’s unencrypted
				data- whether it’s on disk, in memory or transmitted over the network. </p><br>
			<figure class="a">
				<img src="../images/cc11.jpg" width="90%"
					alt="Security and Privacy in Cloud Comoputing">
			</figure>
			<p>Some countries government may decide to search through data without necessarily notifying the
				data owner, depending on where the data resides, which is not appreciated and is
				considered as a privacy breach (Example Prism Program by USA).</p><br>
			<p>To provide security for systems, networks and data cloud computing service providers have
				joined hands with TCG ( Trusted Computing Group) which is non-profit organization which
				regularly releases a set of specifications to secure hardware, create self-encrypting
				drives and improve network security. It protects the data from root kits and malware.
			</p><br>
			<p>As computing has expanded to different devices like hard disk drives and mobile phones, TCG
				has extended the security measures to include these devices. It provides ability to
				create a unified data protection policy across all clouds.</p><br>
			<p>Some of the trusted cloud services are Amazon, Box.net, Gmail and many others.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Privacy Concern & Cloud Computing</h2><br>
			<p>Privacy present a strong barrier for users to adapt into Cloud Computing systems</p><br>
			<p>There are certain measures which can improve privacy in cloud computing.</p><br>
			<ol>
				<li>The administrative staff of the cloud computing service could theoretically monitor
					the data moving in memory before it is stored in disk.To keep the
					confidentiality of a data, administrative and legal controls should prevent this
					from happening.</li>
				<li>The other way for increasing the privacy is to keep the data encrypted at the cloud
					storage site, preventing unauthorized access through the internet; even cloud
					vendor can’t access the data either.</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Case-Study of Cloud Computing- Royal Mail</h2><br>
			<dl>
				<dt>Subject of Case-Study:</dt>
				<dd>Using Cloud Computing for effective communication among staff.</dd>
				<dt>Reason for using Cloud Computing:</dt>
				<dd>Reducing the cost made after communication for 28,000 employees and to provide
					advance features and interface of e-mail services to their employees.</dd>
			</dl><br>
			<p>Royal mail group, a postal service in U.K, is the only government organization in U.K that
				serves over 24 million customers through its 12000 post offices and 3000 separate
				processing sites. Its logistics systems and parcel-force worldwide handles around 404
				million parcel a year. And to do this they need an effective communicative medium. They
				have recognized the advantage of Cloud Computing and implemented it to their system. It
				has shown an outstanding performance in inter-communication.</p><br>
			<p>Before moving on to Cloud system, the organization was struggling with the out-of-date
				software, and due to which the operational efficiency was getting compromised. As soon
				as the organization switched on to Cloud System, 28000 employees were supplied with
				their new collaboration suite, giving them access to tools such as instant messaging and
				presence awareness. The employees got more storage place than on local server. The
				employees became much more productive.</p><br>
			<p>Looking to the success of Cloud Computing in e-mail services and communication .The second
				strategic move of Royal Mail Group, was to migrating from physical servers to virtual
				servers, upto 400 servers to create a private cloud based on Microsoft hyper V. This
				would give a fresh look and additional space to their employees desktop and also
				provides latest modern exchange environment.</p><br>
			<p>The hyper V project by RMG’s (Royal Mail Group) is estimated to save around 1.8 million pound
				for them in future and will increase the efficiency of the organization’s internal IT
				system.</p>
